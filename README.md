# Kaggle-Housing-Prices-Comp
Quick stab at the Housing Prices competition on Kaggle, comparing XGBoost to SKLearn's GBR.

I decided to play around with the ever-ongoing Housing Prices competition on Kaggle, mostly because I've heard that XGBoost is a much better black box than scikit-learn's gradient boosting ensemble regressor.

I really didn't see much difference between SKLearn and XGBoost, so I can't really confirm that XGBoost delivers better results with less effort. If this were a more serious attempt, you'd want to do more feature engineering -- this was just a quick-and-dirty run through for the sake of comparison.
